Have you ever run into the situation where you have a brand new Raspberry Pi, but you don't have an external keyboard, mouse, and monitor to get started? I've been in this situation too. So, when I came across this [blog post](https://www.losant.com/blog/getting-started-with-the-raspberry-pi-zero-w-without-a-monitor), I was ecstatic: the instructions were super helpful and I was able to set up my Pi "headlessly" (i.e. no monitor attached).

To make it even easier for people to get up and running, I created a [GitHub project](https://github.com/drejkim/rpi-setup) that automates parts of the process with a Bash script. The ultimate goal is to remove as many manual steps as possible. If you have any additional feature requests, feel free to post a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/drejkim/rpi-setup/issues) or comment on this post. I'd be happy to work on any updates to make a headless Pi setup as easy as possible.
